# ðŸ‘‹ Hi! This is a project designed to harvest data
The way this works is that it *Snoops* around your data
and figures out what you like! 
***

# The Config
is in `snoopy.json`

# The Code
* src/browser_snoop.py
gets data from user based on browser history

* src/file_snoop.py
gets data from user based on files (executables, etc) on the user machine
